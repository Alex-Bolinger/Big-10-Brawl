# Big-10-Brawl

Welcome to our game, Big 10 Brawl. The idea was simple - create a fighting game where Purdue Pete is obscenely powerful, and the IU mascot (I couldn't care less about what it's name is) is utter trash. In all seriousness, we sought out to create a 2D fighting game loosely based off of classic games such as Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.
